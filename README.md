# Your Passion Project Guide

Welcome to your Passion Project! In this project, you'll combine the power of Google's Teachable Machine with web design to create an interactive application that recognizes images based on your custom-trained model. This is your chance to explore something you're passionate about while learning about AI and web development!

## Getting Started

Press the `Start!` button in the Preview panel to see your model in action! The model included in the template has been trained to recognize mugs, pens, and glasses. Note: It may take a few seconds to load. Press the refresh button in the Preview panel to close the camera.
